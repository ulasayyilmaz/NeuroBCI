This is a neuroscience project Ulas Ayyilmaz and Yotam Twersky built for the class Social Cognitive Affective Neuroscience. We trained CNNs, RNNs and Random Forests on EEG Data, attempted to predict whether the experiment participant is moving their left hand or right hand when they are watching video of someone moving their respective hand.
